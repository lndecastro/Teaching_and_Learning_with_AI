# 2. Class Design and Development
*Designing individual class sessions that align with course goals and engage participants with AI-enhanced learning experiences.*

- Break down content into modules or units  
- Design and create each class session (objectives, contents, materials)  
- Create learning strategies 
- Select and prepare learning materials 
- Integrate discussion and reflect elements 
- Create AI-Powered Class Summary Generator 

## 2.1 Break Down Content Into Modules or Units
**Task:**
Define class sessions and structure by breaking down the course into logical modules or class units.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
I am creating a 5-module course called "Teaching and Learning with AI" for higher education faculty. Propose a structure with a title and description for each module, progressing from foundations to application and reflection.
```

**Sample illustration:** Flowchart or timeline of the 5 modules showing increasing complexity

## 2.2 Design and Create a Single Class Session (Objectives, Contents, Materials)
**Task:**
Design the elements of a session: objectives, contents, and materials.

### A. Direct Prompting on LLMs
**Task:**
Use the content generated by **any LLM** of your choice to create a presentation in a slide generator, e.g. Gamma.app or Power Point, by pasting the resultant text from the prompt.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, main contents, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```

### B. Prompting the Slides' Generator (Presentation) 
**Task:**
Directly prompt the slides' generator, e.g. **Gamma.app or Claude**, and check the presentation produced.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Gamma.app*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, main contents, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Claude.ai*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, main contents, and how generative AI will be used in the session. Create an interactive artifact.
```

### C. Finding Current Scientific Literature
**Task:**
Search the scientific literature for content related with the class subject. Use **SciSpace.com**, option *Literature Review*, to perform your search and analyze the content retrieved.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
AI for assessment and feedback.
```
> **Note:** Save some of the papers retrieved as a literature review material.

### D. Generating Content from Given External Sources
**Task:**
Use a generative model like **Perplexity, NotebookLM, or SciSpace**, to analyze some pre-selected sources of reference and create content from them. Use the papers available below as your source material if needed. <br>

*Step 1:* Create a new Space in Perplexity, Notebook in NotebookLM, or Library/Notebook in SciSpace and title it "AI for Assessment and Feedback". <br>
*Step 2:* Upload your sources of reference (see files below) into the LLM. 
*Step 3 - Chain-of-Thought Prompt:*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, main contents, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```
[Paper_1:](./Data/AIforAssessmentandFeedback.pdf) Artificial intelligence for assessment and feedback to enhance student success in higher education <br>
[Paper_2:](./Data/Feedbacksourcesinessaywriting.pdf) Feedback sources in essay writing: peer-generated or AI-generated feedback? <br>
[Paper_3:](./Data/Assessingstudentperceptions.pdf) Assessing student perceptions and use of instructor versus AI‐generated feedback <br>

> **Note:** After generating your content from your sources, you can use it to create the slides using Power Point, Gamma.app, Copilot, or Claude.ai.

**Sample illustration:** Class session storyboard: Welcome → Demo → Activity → Discussion → Reflection

## 3. Create Learning Activities

**Task:**
Develop participatory activities involving real use of generative AI for teaching and learning.

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are a faculty developer facilitating an AI training session on teaching and learning with AI. Suggest three active learning activities that help participants understand how generative AI can support the teaching and learning processes. Include instructions and necessary tools.
```

**Sample illustration:** Activity icons (e.g., pair-share, AI roleplay, guided prompt lab) linked to learning goals

## 4. Select and Prepare Learning Materials

### Search for and Generate New Learning Materials

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
Suggest a list of materials and resources to support a session on using generative AI for teaching, focusing on the topic "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include at least one reading, one hands-on tool, and one illustrative example of AI-generated content.
```

### Select and Validate Content and Sources
From all the materials generated in the previous items, identify and validate those that can be used as part of your teaching component. 
> **Note:** The GenAI models should be used as assistants to support you in the process of planning, designing, and creating your course, but you must ensure everything is accurate and ready to be presented in class.

**Sample illustration:** Visual toolkit of PDFs, URLs, AI screenshots

## 5. Integrate Discussion and Reflection Elements

**Task:**
Encourage dialogue and deeper thinking about AI in education.

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Examples of reflective questions:
1. What are the potential benefits and risks of using AI-generated assessments and feedback?
2. How would you explain the role of AI to your students?

Now generate 3 more reflection or discussion questions that promote critical thinking about AI in the classroom.
```

**Sample illustration:** Prompt card layout: front = question; back = AI teaching insight

## 6. Create AI-Powered Class Summary Generator

**Task:**
Use LLMs to create a prompt to summarize the lesson automatically using AI.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Write a prompt I can give to an LLM at the end of each class to generate a 1-paragraph summary of key takeaways based on notes or transcripts from a session on [SESSION TOPIC].
```

**Sample illustration:** Before/after comparison of raw transcript → polished AI-generated summary
