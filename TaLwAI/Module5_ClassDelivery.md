Explain how tools like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity support group work or collaborative tasks.
Include timing and instructions.
```

### Example Activity 1. AI‑Augmented Think–Pair–Share

#### Overview
Students individually explore a question with an AI assistant, then pair to compare and critique their AI‑assisted reasoning, and finally share insights with the class.

#### Step‑by‑Step
1. **Think (5 minutes)**  
   Students ask an AI tool the following prompt:  
   ```
   Explain the concept of [Course Topic] in simple terms. 
   Then provide a real-world example and a misconception students often have.
   ```  
   Students review the AI output and annotate:  
   - What parts are clear?  
   - What parts need correction?  
   - What would *you* add?

2. **Pair (5 minutes)**  
   Students compare their annotated answers.  
   They must identify:  
   - One difference in explanations  
   - One misconception flagged by AI  
   - One improvement they propose together  

3. **Share (5–10 minutes)**  
   Pairs report to the class:  
   - How the AI helped  
   - Where the AI struggled  
   - What they learned by comparing explanations  

#### Learning Outcomes
- Improve conceptual clarity  
- Practice evaluating AI-generated content  
- Strengthen metacognitive skills  

### Example Activity 2. AI Debate Partner  

#### Overview
Students debate an issue where the AI acts as a **role-based debating partner**, allowing students to practice argumentation, critique, and evidence use.

#### Prompt for Students
```
You are an expert who argues *in favor* of the position:
[Insert debate statement]

Provide:
1) A clear argument,
2) Evidence-based support,
3) One counterargument you expect from the opposing side.
```

Then students ask:
```
Now switch roles and argue *against* the same statement.
```

#### Debrief Questions
- Which side did AI argue more convincingly?  
- Did the AI hallucinate evidence?  
- How would you strengthen or refute its claims?  

#### Instructor-Led Group Exchange
Students form groups of three:
- Student A: presents one side
- Student B: presents the opposing side
- Student C: acts as the evaluator/referee 

### Example Activity 3. AI Error Analysis  

#### Overview
Students analyze AI-generated mistakes to deepen understanding and improve critical evaluation. This is powerful for math, programming, statistics, logic, or technical writing.

#### Instructor Preparation Prompt
Use this to generate deliberate AI mistakes:
```
Produce a partially incorrect explanation of [Topic].
Include:
- One factual error,
- One reasoning error,
- One ambiguous or vague statement.
Do NOT label the errors.
```

#### Student Task
Students must:
1. Identify each type of error  
2. Correct them  
3. Rewrite the explanation with improved clarity  

#### Reflection
- Why do these errors occur?  
- Which error type is hardest to detect?  
- How can students avoid incorporating AI mistakes into their own work?  

### Example Activity 4. Multi-Tool Comparison Challenge  

#### Overview
Students compare outputs from multiple AI tools to evaluate reasoning quality, evidence, clarity, and limitations.

#### Activity Instructions
Students run the same prompt in each tool (select any set of tools you want to compare):
```
Explain [Course Topic] in 3 levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced.
Include:
- One real-world example,
- One misconception,
- One analogy.
```

#### Analysis Table (Students Complete)

| Criteria | Tool 1 | Tool 2 | Tool 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Clarity |        |        |        |
