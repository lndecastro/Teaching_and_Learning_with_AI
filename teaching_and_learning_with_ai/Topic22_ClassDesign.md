# 2. Class Design and Development
*Designing individual class sessions that align with course goals and engage participants with AI-enhanced learning experiences.*

- Break down content into modules or units  
- Design each class session (objectives, sequence, timing, materials)  
- Incorporate diverse learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)  
- Integrate digital content, simulations, or AI co-creation tools  
- Develop lesson plans, slide decks, and in-class activities  
- Scaffold complexity and cognitive load  

# Hands-on

## 2.1 Break Down Content Into Modules or Units
**Task:**
Define class sessions and structure by breaking down the course into logical modules or class units.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
I am creating a 5-module course called "Teaching and Learning with AI" for higher education faculty. Propose a structure with a title and description for each module, progressing from foundations to application and reflection.
```

## 2.2 Design a Single Class Session
**Task:**
Design the elements of a session: topic, outcomes, activities, timing.

### Direct Prompting on LLMs
**Task:**
Use the content generated by any LLM of your choice to create a presentation in a slide generator, e.g. Gamma.app, by pasting the resultant text from the prompt.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```

### Prompting the Slide Generator
**Task:**
Directly prompt the slide generator, e.g. Gamma.app or Claude, and check the presentation produced.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Gamma.app*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Claude.ai*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, and how generative AI will be used in the session. Create an interactive artifact.
```

### Finding Current Scientific Literature
**Task:**
Search the scientific literature for content related with the class subject. Use SciSpace.com, option *Literature Review*, to perform your search and analyze the content retrieved.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
AI for assessment and feedback.
```
> Save some of the papers retrieved as a literature review material.

### Generating Content from Given External Sources
**Task:**
Use a generative model like Perplexity, NotebookLM, or SciSpace, to analyze some pre-selected sources of reference and create a content from them. Use the papers available below as your source material. <br>
*Step 1:* Create a new Space in Perplexity, Notebook in NotebookLM, or Library/Notebook in SciSpace and title it "AI for Assessment and Feedback". <br>
*Step 2:* Upload your sources of reference (see files below) into the LLM. 
*Step 3 - Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Design a 90-minute session for the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". The topic is "AI for Assessment and Feedback". Include session objectives, sequence of activities with time estimates, and how generative AI will be used in the session.
```
[Paper_1:](./Data/AIforAssessmentandFeedback.pdf) Artificial intelligence for assessment and feedback to enhance student success in higher education <br>
[Paper_2:](./Data/Feedbacksourcesinessaywriting.pdf) Feedback sources in essay writing: peer-generated or AI-generated feedback? <br>
[Paper_3:](./Data/Assessingstudentperceptions.pdf) Assessing student perceptions and use of instructor versus AI‐generated feedback <br>

## 3. Create Active Learning Activities

### Task:
Develop participatory activities involving real use of generative AI.

### Prompt (🔹Role-Based Prompt):
```
You are a faculty developer facilitating an AI training session. Suggest three active learning activities that help participants understand how generative AI can support formative assessment in the classroom. Include instructions and necessary tools.
```

### Illustration:
Activity icons (e.g., pair-share, AI roleplay, guided prompt lab) linked to learning goals

---

## 4. Select and Prepare Learning Materials

### Task:
Identify or generate materials such as handouts, examples, readings.

### Prompt (🔹Zero-Shot Prompt):
```
Suggest a list of materials and resources to support a session on using generative AI for teaching. Include at least one reading, one hands-on tool, and one illustrative example of AI-generated content.
```

### Illustration:
Visual toolkit of PDFs, URLs, AI screenshots

---

## 5. Integrate Discussion and Reflection Elements

### Task:
Encourage dialogue and deeper thinking about AI in education.

### Prompt (🔹Few-Shot Prompt):
```
Examples of reflective questions:
1. What are the potential benefits and risks of using AI-generated feedback?
2. How would you explain the role of AI to your students?

Now generate 3 more reflection or discussion questions that promote critical thinking about AI in the classroom.
```

### Illustration:
Prompt card layout: front = question; back = AI teaching insight

---

## 6. Create AI-Powered Class Summary Generator

### Task:
Summarize the lesson automatically using AI.

### Prompt (🔹Instructional Prompt):
```
Write a prompt I can give to ChatGPT at the end of each class to generate a 1-paragraph summary of key takeaways based on notes or transcripts from a session on AI in education.
```

### Illustration:
Before/after comparison of raw transcript → polished AI-generated summary

---

## 7. Organize Everything in a Lesson Plan Template

### Task:
Compile session details into a usable format for delivery.

### Prompt (🔹Instructional Prompt):
```
Create a lesson plan template for a 90-minute faculty workshop session on teaching with generative AI. Include fields for topic, learning outcomes, time breakdown, tools needed, and prompts to use.
```

### Illustration:
Fillable PDF template or table layout with AI icons next to "prompt to use" fields
