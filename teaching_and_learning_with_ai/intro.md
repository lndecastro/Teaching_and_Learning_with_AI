# Welcome to the "Teaching and Learning with AI" Workshop

This training focuses on integrating generative AI into the Teaching and Learning (TaL) process. It covers a comprehensive framework for TaL with AI, moving from strategic planning through delivery, assessment, support, and reflection. A key component is prompt engineering, the practice of crafting effective inputs for AI models. The training emphasizes strategic communication with AI systems to produce accurate, relevant, and useful outputs for educational purposes.

## 2. What You Will Learn

You will learn how to incorporate AI into various stages of the teaching process, including planning, class design, preparing assignments and exams, class delivery, student support, assessment, and reflection. A significant portion of the training is dedicated to understanding and applying prompt engineering techniques to guide AI models effectively. You will learn about different types of tools, prompts, how to structure them, and how to improve AI outputs through iteration. 

To start this discussion, let us have a look at Chegg's 2025 global student survey, which brings an overview of how college students across the globe are facing their academic life during this AI era.

- **Leverage generative AI tools and techniques** to assist in pedagogical-didactic planning, including defining learning outcomes, identifying audience and context, selecting pedagogical approaches, choosing educational technologies, aligning with guidelines, and drafting course syllabi.
- **Design and develop class sessions and course materials** by breaking down content into modules, structuring sessions, finding relevant literature, generating content from sources, and creating learning activities with AI support.
- **Prepare assignments and exams** by designing formative and summative assessments, creating authentic tasks (quizzes, case studies, projects), developing clear rubrics, and considering accessibility and academic integrity, utilizing AI as an assistant.
- **Integrate generative AI tools and strategies into class delivery** to facilitate active and student-centered learning, employ various content delivery methods, monitor engagement and comprehension, and adapt instruction responsively.
- **Enhance student support structures** by using AI to supplement office hours and respond to inquiries, offer guidance on assignments and study strategies, monitor student success, provide AI-curated resources, encourage peer collaboration, and explore the introduction of AI tutors.
- **Apply AI tools and techniques to assessment and feedback processes**, including conducting assessments with AI support, generating rubric-based constructive feedback, facilitating AI-assisted self- and peer-assessment, and exploring AI for grading and originality verification.
- **Utilize generative AI for reflection and continuous improvement** of teaching practices, including identifying effective elements, revising materials and strategies, staying engaged with research, sharing experiences, and analyzing student feedback and data.

## 4. Structure and Approach
