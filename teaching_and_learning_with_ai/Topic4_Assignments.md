# 4. Preparation of Assignments and Exams
*This phase involves designing AI-assisted assessment strategies that align with learning goals while promoting authenticity, clarity, and integrity*

This phase involves designing AI-assisted assessment strategies that align with learning goals while promoting authenticity, clarity, and integrity. Key tasks include designing formative and summative assessments, creating authentic tasks like case studies or AI-assisted projects, developing clear rubrics to define performance expectations, and ensuring accessibility and academic integrity. AI can assist in differentiating assessment types, designing real-world tasks, and drafting rubrics. The main topics to be covered here are:

1. Design formative and summative assessments aligned with the learning outcomes  
2. Create authentic tasks (e.g., Quiz, exams, case studies, real-world problems, AI-assisted projects)
3. Create rubrics to define performance expectations  
4. Ensure accessibility and academic integrity  

## 4.1 Design Formative and Summative Assessments Aligned with Learning Outcomes

**Task:**
Create assessments that track progress (formative) and evaluate mastery (summative) based on previously defined course outcomes.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Explain the difference between formative and summative assessments in the context of learning. Then, generate an example of each for a course about using generative AI in higher education.
```

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Based on the following learning outcome from a course on "Teaching and Learning with AI": 
"Evaluate the benefits and limitations of using generative AI for instructional design" — 
suggest one formative and one summative assessment that align with this outcome.
```

**Sample illustration:** Split diagram showing formative vs. summative assessments, examples for each.

## 4.2 Create Authentic Tasks (Quizzes, Exams, Case Studies, Real-World Problems, AI-Assisted Projects)

**Task:** 
Design assignments that reflect real-world work or AI-enhanced practices in education.

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an instructional designer creating a real-world, authentic task for a faculty up-skill course on the use of GenAI in education. Create an assignment where faculty must design a teaching activity using generative AI and include a rationale for how AI enhances learning.
```

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
Give three examples of authentic, real-world assignments for a course on teaching with AI. Include one quiz with 5 questions, one AI-supported case study, and one project-based task. For all of them, provide correct answers.
```

**Sample illustration:** Infographic showing assignment types with AI-enhancement icons (quiz, case, project).

## 4.3 Create Rubrics to Define Performance Expectations

**Task:**
Use GenAI to draft clear rubrics to ensure transparency and consistency in grading.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Create a rubric for the following assignment: 
"Design a lesson plan that incorporates generative AI tools to enhance student learning." 
Use three criteria: Pedagogical soundness, Effective AI integration, and Clarity of design. For each criteria you must add ratings and points.
Assume the ratings follow a Likert Scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), and the total points per assignment is 10.
```

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Example of rubric criteria for evaluating a faculty AI teaching activity:
1. Alignment with learning outcomes
2. Use of AI supports instructional purpose
3. Ethical considerations are addressed

Now generate a full 3-level rubric (Excellent, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement) based on these.
```

**Sample illustration:** Rubric grid with sample criteria and rating scales.

## 4.4 Ensure Accessibility and Academic Integrity

**Task:**
Use GenAI to review or generate assessments with accessibility in mind and minimize integrity issues.

*Role-Based Prompt for accessibility*
```
You are an educator designing an inclusive assignment using generative AI. What principles should guide your design to ensure accessibility (e.g., for neurodiverse or multilingual learners)? Include examples of modifications.
```

*Instructional Prompt for integrity*
```
Suggest five ways to promote academic integrity in AI-assisted assignments. For each, include a strategy to monitor or mitigate misuse of generative tools.
```

**Sample illustration:** Checklist diagram with “Accessibility” and “Integrity” columns side-by-side.
