# 3. AI-Enhanced Class Design and Development
*Designing individual class sessions that align with course goals and engage participants with AI-enhanced learning experiences.*

This phase is about structuring the learning experience for clarity, engagement, and progression. It involves breaking down content into modules or units, designing individual class sessions with defined objectives, contents, and materials, creating learning strategies, selecting and preparing learning materials, and integrating discussion and reflection elements. AI can be used here to help design session elements, find relevant scientific literature, generate content from sources, and create learning activities and materials. 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- Break down content into structured modules.
- Build session plans using prompt templates.
- Generate literature-informed content, examples, activities.
- Integrate multimodal AI-generated diagrams and artifacts.
- Create an AI-powered class summary generator.

## 3.1 Break Down Content Into Modules or Units

### Purpose
Translate course-level goals and outcomes into a usable modular structure that drives session planning, scaffolding, and pacing.

### Prompt Template — Instructional + Role-Based
```
You are an instructional designer working inside the [Workspace/Project Name]. 
Break down the course [Course Title] into modules or class sessions. 
For each module, provide: 1) title, 2) description, 3) key concepts, 
4) materials, 5) applications, and 6) reflection.
Ground your proposal in the uploaded syllabus and course outcomes.
```

### Additional Prompt Variant — Instructional
```
I am creating a modular course called [Course Title] for higher education students.
Propose a structure with a title and description for each module, progressing from foundations to application and reflection.
```

## 3.2 Design and Create a Class Session (Objectives, Contents, Materials)

### Purpose
Develop structured, high‑quality class plans supported by AI: objectives, content, teaching strategies, timing, and required materials.

### A. Direct Prompting on LLMs
**Task:**
Use the content generated by **any LLM** of your choice to create a presentation in a slide generator, e.g. **Gamma.app or Power Point**, by pasting the resultant text from the prompt.

**Prompt Template — Instructional + Role-Based**
```
You are an instructional designer working on the course [Course Title].
Design a 90-minute session for [Course Title] on the topic [Topic Name]. Include: 
- Session objectives 
- Sequence of activities with time estimates

- Required materials  
- How AI will be used during the session 
- Optional multimodal artifacts (slides, diagrams, examples)
```

### B. Prompting the AI Slide Generator 
**Task:**
Accelerate production of professional-quality presentations and supporting visuals. Directly prompt the slides' generator, e.g. **Gamma.app, Canva, PowerPoint+Copilot, Scispace, Claude**, check and refine the presentation produced.

**Prompt Template — Slide Generator (Gamma, Canva, PPT+Copilot)**
```
Generate a visually-engaging slide deck for a 90-minute class titled [Class Title].
Include objectives, diagrams, examples, teaching steps, risks, and interactive elements.
```

> **Note:** As an alternative, instead of prompting the slide generator tool, you could prompt an LLM to generate the slides' contents for you and then copy-paste this content into a tool that designs and formats the slides, such as Gamma.app. 

**Prompt Template for Claude.ai**
```
Generate a visually-engaging slide deck for a 90-minute class titled [Class Title].
Include objectives, diagrams, examples, teaching steps, risks, and interactive elements.
