# 2. Pedagogical-Didactic Planning
*Strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching*

- Define course goals and learning outcomes  
- Identify audience and context 
- Select pedagogical approaches (e.g., active learning, inquiry-based, project-based)  
- Choose educational technologies and AI-enhanced tools  
- Align with institutional and ethical guidelines
- Create the course Syllabus

## 2.1 Define Course Goals and Learning Outcomes
**Task:**
Clarify what learners should be able to know, do, or value by the end of the course.

*Instructional + Role-Based Prompt*
```
I am a higher-education teacher designing a course titled "Teaching and Learning with AI". The target audience is higher education faculty and students. Suggest 3–5 clear learning outcomes using Bloom’s taxonomy across different cognitive levels. Focus on skills related to using generative AI for teaching, learning, and assessment.

*Instructional Prompt Used for the Interactive Artifact*
```
Teaching and Learning with AI. Create a diagram of Bloom’s Taxonomy pyramid with example verbs for each level (Remember → Create), linking each level to potential GenAI teaching practices.
```

## 2.2 Identify Audience and Context
**Task:**
Profile the expected learners (background, skills, attitudes) and delivery context (online, in-person, hybrid).

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an instructional designer creating faculty development programs. Describe the learner profile for a course on "Teaching and Learning with AI" aimed at university instructors from various disciplines. Include background knowledge, teaching experience, tech comfort, and possible challenges.
```

## 2.3 Select Pedagogical Approach(es)
**Task:**
Decide how learning will happen: lecture, problem-based learning, flipped classroom, co-creation, etc. Choose teaching methods aligned with learning goals and context.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Given that the course aims to teach faculty how to use generative AI in teaching and learning, what are three suitable pedagogical models (e.g., flipped classroom, problem-based learning)? For each, explain how it supports the learning goals, and how AI could enhance the model.
```

## 2.4 Choose Tools and Technologies
**Task:**
Identify generative AI tools and explain their educational uses.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
List 5 generative AI tools suitable for a course on teaching with AI. For each tool, describe its main use in teaching or learning, and mention one risk or limitation.
```

## 2.5 Align with Institutional and Ethical Guidelines
**Task:**
Draft ethical and policy-aligned foundations for AI use.

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Below are examples of AI use policies in education:

1. AI may assist with feedback but must be transparent to students.
2. AI must not be used to generate grades or evaluations without human review.
3. AI cannot be used to complete an entire assignment for you.
4. AI cannot be used to re-word their ideas and present them as your own without giving them credit.

Based on these, generate a draft of an AI use policy for a course on teaching with AI that incorporates transparency, accountability, and fairness. The "AI Use Policies" must contain: an introductory paragraph that explain what is AI and contextualize it for the course; a description of what is acceptable and unacceptable in terms of AI use for the course; citation requirements and procedures; list of prompts used; a summary table of all uses of AI in the course.
```

## 2.6 Create the Course Syllabus
**Task:**
Based on a pre-specified syllabus format, let the AI model create a syllabus for our course.
> Note that the prompt below may contain sections that were previously prompted, e.g. Learning Objectives, and AI Use Policies. You can also attach your previous syllabus or the structure of your desired syllabus and prompt the model to use it as template.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
# Syllabus Generator Prompt

Please provide the following details to generate a syllabus for your course. Use the structure and style of the provided example syllabus, including sections for course information, professor information, course description, course program, bibliography, student learning outcomes, instructional method, evaluation and grade assignments, assignments, final exam, attendance policy, student contact information, notes, core syllabus policies, and a tentative weekly schedule. Fill in the placeholders with the relevant information for your course.
