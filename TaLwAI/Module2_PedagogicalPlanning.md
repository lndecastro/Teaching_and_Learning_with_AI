# 2. AI-Enhanced Pedagogical-Didactic Planning
*Strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching*

This module focuses on the strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching. It involves defining course goals and learning outcomes, identifying the audience and context, selecting appropriate pedagogical approaches, choosing educational technologies and AI-enhanced tools, aligning with institutional and ethical guidelines, and creating the course syllabus. You will explore how generative AI can assist with tasks like drafting learning outcomes using frameworks such as Bloom's Taxonomy and generating draft policies. <p>

> **Note**: All prompts that you use from this module onwards should be made within your AI Workspace, because this will ensure that you build upon the project you created and all developments are consistent with the instructions provided and knowledge base uploaded.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:

- Draft and refine course goals and measurable learning outcomes using Bloom’s Taxonomy.
- Generate learner profiles, identify audience and context.
- Select pedagogical approaches aligned with outcomes and AI-enhanced teaching strategies.
- Choose appropriate AI tools and technologies for planning, delivery, and assessment.
- Align course elements with institutional and ethical guidelines.
- Use AI to draft, audit, and refine complete syllabus documents.
- Integrate prompt engineering and context engineering in planning workflows.

## 2.1 Define Course Goals and Learning Outcomes

### Purpose
Use AI to generate, refine, align, and audit learning outcomes across cognitive levels.

### Prompt Template — Instructional + Role-Based
```
You are a higher-education instructional designer. 
Generate 4–6 measurable learning outcomes for a course titled [Course Name].
Use Bloom’s taxonomy across different levels and focus on skills related to [insert skills].
Present results in a table: Outcome | Bloom Level | Example Assessment.
```

> Note that in the prompt above you can add or attach a course description or materials to guide the model in the creation of the learning outcomes. These contents could alternatively be added as files in your workspace (project).

### Additional Prompt Variant — Alignment Check
```
Check whether the learning outcomes below align with Bloom’s taxonomy levels.
Identify any non-measurable verbs and suggest revisions.

## 2.2 Identify Audience and Context

### Purpose
AI supports instructors in developing learner personas that guide pedagogical decisions.

### Prompt Template — Role-Based
```
You are an instructional designer. Create a learner profile for a course on [Course subject].
Include: background knowledge, experience, motivations, tech comfort level, possible challenges, and accessibility considerations.
Present in a table.
```

### Additional Prompt Variant — Multiple Profiles
```
Create three learner personas: beginner, mixed-background, and advanced.
Describe needs, risks, and recommended adaptations for each.
```

## 2.3 Select Pedagogical Approach(es)

### Purpose
Match learning outcomes and student profiles with effective pedagogical models.

### Prompt Template — Chain-of-Thought
```
Given the learning outcomes and audience profile below,
identify three pedagogical models that fit this course. 
For each, reason step-by-step how it supports the outcomes, 
and give two examples of how AI can enhance activities in that model.

[Paste the learning outcomes and profile here]
```

## Additional Prompt Variant — Activity Generator
```

Include Bloom level, estimated time, and resources needed.
```

## 2.4 Choose Tools and Technologies

## Purpose
AI helps instructors curate tools aligned with course goals and teaching modality.

## Prompt Template — Zero-Shot
```
List 5 generative AI tools most suitable for teaching the course "[Course Title]". 
For each, describe one educational use and one limitation or risk.
Present results in a table.
```

## Additional Prompt Variant — Matching Tools to Activities
```
Given these planned learning activities [paste],
suggest the best AI tools and justify how each tool supports the task.
```

**Task:**
Identify generative AI tools and explain their educational uses.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
List 5 generative AI tools suitable for a course on teaching with AI. For each tool, describe its main use in teaching or learning, and mention one risk or limitation.
```

## 2.5 Align with Institutional and Ethical Guidelines
**Task:**
Draft ethical and policy-aligned foundations for AI use by the students. The general FGCU AI use policies are available at the link below: 
https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/generative-ai

The following files contain the general FGCU policies for GenAI use. Download them and use as the institutional policies for GenAI use. <br>
[Student_Code_of_Conduct](./Data/Regulation4002_Student_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) <br>
[General_FGCU_GenAI_Policies](./Data/GenerativeAIandFGCUTeachingandLearning.pdf) <br>
[Core_Syllabus_Policies_Statements](./Data/CoreSyllabusPolicyStatements.pdf) <br>

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Below are examples of AI use policies for learning:

1. Submitting the work of another person or entity as your own is not permitted. “Entity” includes Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.
2. Receiving assistance that has not been authorized by the course instructor is not permitted. This includes assistance from Generative AI tools.
3. Students should not use of sources that go beyond those authorized by the instructor. This includes using Generative AI tools as a source.

Based on these and the attached files with the university policies, generate a draft of an AI use policy for a course on [Course Name/Info] that incorporates transparency, accountability, and fairness.
The "AI Use Policies" must contain: an introductory paragraph that explain what is AI and contextualize it for the course; a description of what is acceptable and unacceptable in terms of AI use for the course; citation requirements and procedures; list of prompts used; a summary table of all uses of AI in the course.
```

## 2.6 Create the Course Syllabus
**Task:**
Based on a pre-specified syllabus format, let the AI model create a syllabus for our course.
> Note that the prompt below may contain sections that were previously prompted, e.g. Learning Objectives, and AI Use Policies. You can also attach your previous syllabus or the structure of your desired syllabus and prompt the model to use it as template.
