# 5. Student Support  
_Promoting academic success and well-being_

This phase focuses on using generative AI to enhance the support structures available to learners, fostering inclusivity, personalization, and early intervention.

## 5.1 Provide Office Hours and Timely Responses to Inquiries

**Task:** 
In addition to your office hours, use generative AI to supplement your availability and provide consistent, supportive responses to common student queries.

### Tool 1: General LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, etc.)
Upload your course material and prompt the LLMs to generate the FAQ.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Read the attached PDF file(s) and generate a structured FAQ section that summarizes the key aspects of the material. 
Ensure each FAQ includes a clear question and a concise, informative answer, and group the FAQs into thematic categories.
```

### Tool 2: Perplexity
Create a *Space* with your course material and prompt the LLMs to generate the FAQ. Use the same *instructional prompt* presented above.

### Tool 3: NotebookLM
Create a *Notebook* with your course material and use button **FAQ** to generate the FAQ. 

**Sample illustration** Inbox of AI-generated response examples, labeled by type.

## 5.2 Offer Guidance on Assignments and Study Strategies

**Task**
Use AI to offer personalized academic coaching or scaffolded support on deliverables.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
Provide five examples of how generative AI can help faculty learners in a course about AI pedagogy better understand and complete their assignments. Include study strategies and task breakdowns.
```
