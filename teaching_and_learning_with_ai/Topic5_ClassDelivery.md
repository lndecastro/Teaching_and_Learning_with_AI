# 5. Teaching the Class (Class Delivery)  
_*Enacting the instructional plan with flexibility and engagement*_

This phase focuses on delivering instruction dynamically and responsively while integrating generative AI tools to enhance engagement, learning and personalization.

- Facilitate active, student-centered learning (e.g., discussion, problem-solving)  
- Use storytelling, examples, demonstrations, and Socratic questioning  
- Employ tech and AI tools for content delivery (e.g., ChatGPT, simulations, visualizations)  
- Monitor engagement and comprehension in real time  
- Adapt pacing and methods responsively  

## 5.1 Facilitate Active, Student-Centered Learning

**Task:** 
Create interactive learning experiences where students engage through collaboration, problem-solving, and reflection.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Suggest three active learning strategies that leverage generative AI for a course on teaching with AI. Include how tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity can support group discussion or collaborative tasks.
```

**Sample illustration:** Diagram comparing passive vs. active learning with AI use cases (e.g., “AI as a peer in group discussion”).

## 5.2 Use Storytelling, Examples, Demonstrations, and Socratic Questioning

**Task:**
Deliver compelling instruction using narrative, examples, and critical questioning with AI support.

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an educator teaching a session on AI in education. Generate a real-world story or scenario where an instructor uses AI to improve student engagement. Then, create 3 Socratic questions based on this scenario to stimulate discussion.
```

**Sample illustration:** Storyboard of a mini-case and AI-enhanced dialogue with questions.

## 5.3 Employ Technology and AI Tools for Content Delivery

**Task:**
Leverage academic generative AI tools to present, demonstrate, simulate or interact with course content in diverse formats.

The paper titled _Feedback sources in essay writing: peer-generated or AI-generated feedback?_ investigates the **quality of feedback provided by ChatGPT compared to peer feedback** on graduate students' argumentative essays. The findings revealed that **peer feedback was generally of higher quality**, particularly in identifying specific issues within the essays, while **ChatGPT provided more descriptive feedback**.  The researchers found **no significant overall correlation between essay quality and feedback quality** from either source, suggesting a potential **complementary role for both ChatGPT and peers** in the feedback process, which could help reduce teacher workload.

### Exploring Possibilities
*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
List five ways to use generative AI tools for content delivery in a teaching session. Include one example each for text, visual, code, and slide generation.
```

### Tool 1: SciSpace
**Task 1:** Using function **Chat with PDF** upload the paper about feedback in essay writing and start by asking the pre-defined general questions to the paper. Then evolve to some questions you may have around the topic. <br>

**Task 2:** Using function "PDF to Video" in SciSpace, upload one of the the slide decks generated in _Topic 2.2 Class Design_ and let SciSpace generate a video presentation of your content. As soon as the video presentation is ready, play it to see what was created. <br> 

**Task 3:** Now test functions **Find Topics**, **Citation generator**, and **Extract data**.

**Task 4:** Use function **Paraphraser** to write clear and original content out of the paper under study.

### Tool 2: NotebookLM
**Task 1:** Using button **FAQ** generate a list of questions related with the paper. <br>

**Task 2:** Using button **Audio Overview** create a podcast out of the paper. After created, use the button **Interactive mode** to join the conversation and ask some of the questions created in **Task 1**. <br>

**Task 3:** Using button **Mind Map** create a mind map out of the paper. Navigate through the mind map and discuss how it helps to organize and structure the contents of the paper. <br>

**Task 4:** Using button **Study guide** create some questions and answers related with the subject matter of the paper, and a glossary of terms. <br>

**Task 5:** Upload the paper below that summarizes the history of Artificial Intelligence and create a timeline using button **Timeline**. Analyze the timeline created for consistency and have a look at the cast of characters generated. <br>

## 5.4 Monitor Engagement and Comprehension in Real Time

**Task:**
Track student participation, attention, and understanding with the help of AI tools and quick feedback loops.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
How can generative AI assist instructors in monitoring student comprehension during a live class? Describe a step-by-step strategy using real-time tools or AI-supported questioning techniques.
```

> In groups discuss which of the strategies you are going to use and why.

**Sample illustration:** Live feedback loop with icons: Teach → Ask AI-generated poll → Visualize → Adapt.

## 5.5 Adapt Pacing and Methods Responsively

**Task:**
Use AI feedback and intuition to adjust the delivery in real time or between sessions.

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Examples of how instructors adapt teaching pace:
1. Slowing down to explain misunderstood content
2. Skipping ahead when concepts are mastered quickly

Now generate an AI-assisted strategy for adapting pace during a session using generative AI tools or analytics.
```

**Sample illustration** Flowchart with “Observe → Analyze with AI → Adjust” model for pacing.
