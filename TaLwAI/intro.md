# Teaching with AI

Welcome to the **Teaching with AI Program**, part of the **FGCU AI Academy** led by the **Dendritic Institute for Human-Centered AI & Data Science** at Florida Gulf Coast University. This program is designed for **faculty and instructors seeking practical, hands-on methods for integrating Generative AI tools throughout the teaching and learning cycle**. Unlike pedagogical or learning-science programs, which are covered separately in the Academy, **this training focuses on the instrumental and operational use of AI**.

## Disclaimer
This training is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI tools in educational contexts. It is not an endorsement of using AI-generated content without human expertise, oversight, or academic judgment, nor is it a prescriptive guide for its use. Faculty remain fully responsible for:
- Curating and validating instructional content
- Disclosing when and how AI tools are used
- Ensuring the ethical, responsible, and context-appropriate integration of AI into teaching and learning

Academic content must always be aligned with the subject matter, learning objectives, institutional context and policies, and professional standards. While AI can assist in content creation and instructional design (AI-assisted), it should not replace the critical role of educators (not AI-driven).

## 1. Program Goals

The goal of this program is to equip instructors with practical, immediately applicable skills for using GenAI across:

- Strategic planning 
- Class and course design  
- Class delivery  
- Assessment and feedback  
- Student support  
- Reflection and continuous improvement  

The the basic background necessary to use GenAI tools is presented in the AI Literacy program. If you need some introductory knowledge on prompt engineering and a general understanding of AI and its history, we invite you to take that program before proceeding with this one. 

## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this program, participants should be able to:

- **Understand the comprehensive framework** for integrating generative AI into the teaching and learning process, recognizing its application across strategic planning, design, delivery, support, assessment, and reflection phases.
- **Organize your AI workspace and create personalized assistants** to enhance teaching and learning and leverage AI tools to support pedagogical planning, content generation, instructional decision-making, and student support.
- **Design and develop class sessions and course materials** by breaking down content into modules, structuring sessions, finding relevant literature, generating content from sources, and creating learning activities with AI support.
- **Prepare assignments and exams** by designing formative and summative assessments, creating authentic tasks (quizzes, case studies, projects), developing clear rubrics, and considering accessibility and academic integrity, utilizing AI as an assistant.
- **Integrate generative AI tools and strategies into class delivery** to facilitate active and student-centered learning, employ various content delivery methods, monitor engagement and comprehension, and adapt instruction responsively.
- **Enhance student support structures** by using AI to supplement office hours and respond to inquiries, offer guidance on assignments and study strategies, monitor student success, provide AI-curated resources, encourage peer collaboration, and explore the introduction of AI tutors.
- **Apply AI tools and techniques to assessment and feedback processes**, including conducting assessments with AI support, generating rubric-based constructive feedback, facilitating AI-assisted self- and peer-assessment, and exploring AI for grading and originality verification.
- **Utilize generative AI for reflection and continuous improvement** of teaching practices, including identifying effective elements, revising materials and strategies, staying engaged with research, sharing experiences, and analyzing student feedback and data.

## 3. Structure and Approach

Each session is structured around a short introduction, hands-on activities, and a reflection period. You will be encouraged to:

- Experiment with AI prompts and structures tailored to your professional context
