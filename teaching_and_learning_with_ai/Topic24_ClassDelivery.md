# 4. Teaching the Class (Class Delivery)  
_*Enacting the instructional plan with flexibility and engagement*_

This phase focuses on delivering instruction dynamically and responsively while integrating generative AI tools to enhance engagement, learning and personalization.

## 4.1 Facilitate Active, Student-Centered Learning

**Task:** 
Create interactive learning experiences where students engage through collaboration, problem-solving, and reflection.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Suggest three active learning strategies that leverage generative AI for a course on teaching with AI. Include how tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity can support group discussion or collaborative tasks.
```

**Sample illustration:** Diagram comparing passive vs. active learning with AI use cases (e.g., “AI as a peer in group discussion”).

## 4.2 Use Storytelling, Examples, Demonstrations, and Socratic Questioning

**Task:**
Deliver compelling instruction using narrative, examples, and critical questioning with AI support.

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an educator teaching a session on AI in education. Generate a real-world story or scenario where an instructor uses AI to improve student engagement. Then, create 3 Socratic questions based on this scenario to stimulate discussion.
```

**Sample illustration:** Storyboard of a mini-case and AI-enhanced dialogue with questions.

## 4.3 Employ Technology and AI Tools for Content Delivery

**Task:**
Leverage generative AI tools to present, demonstrate, or simulate course content in diverse formats.

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
List five ways to use generative AI tools for content delivery in a teaching session. Include one example each for text, visual, code, and slide generation.
```

**Sample illustration:** Tool palette showing AI tools mapped to content types (text, image, code, slides).

## 👀 4. Monitor Engagement and Comprehension in Real Time

### 📌 Task:
Track student participation, attention, and understanding with the help of AI tools and quick feedback loops.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Chain-of-Thought Prompt):
```
How can generative AI assist instructors in monitoring student comprehension during a live class? Describe a step-by-step strategy using real-time tools or AI-supported questioning techniques.
```

### 🖼 Illustration:
Live feedback loop with icons: Teach → Ask AI-generated poll → Visualize → Adapt.

## ⏩ 5. Adapt Pacing and Methods Responsively

### 📌 Task:
Use AI feedback and intuition to adjust the delivery in real time or between sessions.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Few-Shot Prompt):
```
Examples of how instructors adapt teaching pace:
1. Slowing down to explain misunderstood content
2. Skipping ahead when concepts are mastered quickly

Now generate an AI-assisted strategy for adapting pace during a session using generative AI tools or analytics.
```

### 🖼 Illustration:
Flowchart with “Observe → Analyze with AI → Adjust” model for pacing.
