## 3. Structure and Approach

Each session is structured around a short introduction, hands-on activity, and a reflection period. You will be encouraged to:

- Experiment with AI prompts tailored to your professional context
- Compare outputs across different tools
- Share findings and discuss best practices
- Develop your own AI-enhanced components

At the end of the workshop, participants will complete a final project applying AI tools to a task relevant to their field or organization.
