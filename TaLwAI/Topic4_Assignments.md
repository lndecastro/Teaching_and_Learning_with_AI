# 4. Preparation of Assignments and Exams
*This phase involves designing AI-assisted assessment strategies that align with learning goals while promoting authenticity, clarity, and integrity*

This phase involves designing AI-assisted assessment strategies that align with learning goals while promoting authenticity, clarity, and integrity. Key tasks include designing formative and summative assessments, creating authentic tasks like case studies or AI-assisted projects, developing clear rubrics to define performance expectations, and ensuring accessibility and academic integrity. AI can assist in differentiating assessment types, designing real-world tasks, and drafting rubrics. 

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:

- Design formative and summative assessments aligned with course learning outcomes.
- Create authentic, real‑world AI‑enhanced tasks such as quizzes, exams, case studies, and projects.
- Develop clear, consistent, AI‑assisted rubrics.
- Ensure accessibility and academic integrity in all AI‑supported assessments.

## 4.1 Design Formative and Summative Assessments Aligned with Learning Outcomes

### Purpose  
Use GenAI to understand and design assessments that track learning progress (formative) and evaluate mastery (summative), ensuring alignment with the course learning outcomes.

### Prompt — Instructional
```
Explain the difference between formative and summative assessments in the context of learning.
Provide technical or scientific references from the literature about these two types of assessments.
Then generate an example of each for a course on [Course Title/Topic].
```

### Course-Tailored Prompt — Instructional
```
Based on the learning outcomes presented below, suggest one formative and one summative assessment aligned with them.
[Learning Outcomes]
```

> **Note 1:** You can use the same or a similar prompt for each learning outcome.
> **Note 2:** If you know the type of assignment you want to create, you can prompt the model to create exactly that type of assignment.

## 4.2 Create Authentic Tasks (Quizzes, Exams, Case Studies, Projects)

STOPPED HERE

### Purpose  
Generate real‑world, meaningful tasks that reflect authentic professional or academic scenarios enhanced with GenAI.

### Example Prompt — Role‑Based
```
You are an instructional designer creating a real-world, authentic task for a course on [Course Title/Topic].
Create an assignment where the students must use generative AI whilst still acquiring the required knowledge,
skills and critical thinking associated with the topic.
Include a rationale for how AI enhances learning.
```

### Example Prompt — Zero‑Shot
```
Give three examples of authentic, real-world assignments for a course on teaching with AI.
Include one quiz with 5 questions, one AI-supported case study, and one project-based task. Provide correct answers.
```

### Recommended GenAI Tools  
- **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / Perplexity** — generate quiz items, scenarios, variants  
- **Gamma / Napkin / Canva** — convert tasks into visuals or interactive formats  
- **SciSpace / ExplainPaper** — create tasks based on academic articles  
- **NotebookLM** — case study generation grounded in provided documents  


**Task:** 
Design assignments that reflect real-world work or AI-enhanced practices in education.

*Role-Based Prompt*
```
You are an instructional designer creating a real-world, authentic task for a faculty up-skill course on the use of GenAI in education. Create an assignment where faculty must design a teaching activity using generative AI and include a rationale for how AI enhances learning.
```

*Zero-Shot Prompt*
```
Give three examples of authentic, real-world assignments for a course on teaching with AI. Include one quiz with 5 questions, one AI-supported case study, and one project-based task. For all of them, provide correct answers.
```

**Sample illustration:** Infographic showing assignment types with AI-enhancement icons (quiz, case, project).

## 4.3 Create Rubrics to Define Performance Expectations

**Task:**
Use GenAI to draft clear rubrics to ensure transparency and consistency in grading.

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Create a rubric for the following assignment: 
"Design a lesson plan that incorporates generative AI tools to enhance student learning." 
Use three criteria: Pedagogical soundness, Effective AI integration, and Clarity of design. For each criteria you must add ratings and points.
Assume the ratings follow a Likert Scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), and the total points per assignment is 10.
```

*Few-Shot Prompt*
```
Example of rubric criteria for evaluating a faculty AI teaching activity:
1. Alignment with learning outcomes
2. Use of AI supports instructional purpose
3. Ethical considerations are addressed

Now generate a full 3-level rubric (Excellent, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement) based on these.
```

**Sample illustration:** Rubric grid with sample criteria and rating scales.

## 4.4 Ensure Accessibility and Academic Integrity

**Task:**
Use GenAI to review or generate assessments with accessibility in mind and minimize integrity issues.

*Role-Based Prompt for accessibility*
```
You are an educator designing an inclusive assignment using generative AI. What principles should guide your design to ensure accessibility (e.g., for neurodiverse or multilingual learners)? Include examples of modifications.
```

*Instructional Prompt for integrity*
```
Suggest five ways to promote academic integrity in AI-assisted assignments. For each, include a strategy to monitor or mitigate misuse of generative tools.
```

**Sample illustration:** Checklist diagram with “Accessibility” and “Integrity” columns side-by-side.
