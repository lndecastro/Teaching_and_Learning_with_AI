## 🧭 1. Reflect on Teaching Effectiveness Using Feedback and Data

### 📌 Task:
Use AI to synthesize student feedback, learning outcomes, and peer observations to assess instructional impact.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Instructional Prompt):
```
Given the following inputs:
- Student feedback surveys (text)
- Assignment performance data (table)
- Peer review notes (text)

Use generative AI to summarize key strengths and weaknesses in the course "Teaching and Learning with AI". Highlight teaching strategies that worked well and areas that need improvement.

## 🤝 5. Share Experiences to Foster Reflective Practice

### 📌 Task:
Use generative AI to craft reflective narratives or conversation starters to share with peers or publish in teaching and learning communities.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Few-Shot Prompt):
```
Examples of reflective statements:
1. “I found that using generative AI to co-create rubrics gave students clearer expectations.”
2. “Next time, I’ll scaffold AI tool use earlier to avoid overload.”

Now generate a reflective blog post or faculty discussion prompt that captures your experiences in designing and delivering the course ‘Teaching and Learning with AI’.
