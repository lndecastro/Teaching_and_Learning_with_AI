## 1. Pedagogical-Didactic Planning
*Strategic and intentional groundwork for teaching*

- Define course goals and learning outcomes  
- Identify audience and context 
- Select pedagogical approaches (e.g., active learning, inquiry-based, project-based)  
- Choose educational technologies and AI-enhanced tools  
- Align with institutional and ethical guidelines
- Create the course Syllabus

## 2. Class Design and Development
*Structuring the learning experience for clarity, engagement, and progression*

- Break down content into modules or units  
- Design and create each class session (objectives, contents, materials)  
- Create learning strategies 
- Select and prepare learning materials 
- Integrate discussion and reflect elements 
- Create AI-Powered Class Summary Generator
  
## 3. Preparation of Assignments and Exams
*Creating opportunities for practice, application, and evaluation*

- Design formative and summative assessments aligned with learning outcomes  
- Use rubrics to define performance expectations  
- Create authentic tasks (e.g., case studies, real-world problems, AI-assisted projects)  
- Balance low- and high-stakes activities  
- Ensure accessibility and academic integrity  
- Use AI to draft, refine, or personalize assignments and quizzes  

## 4. Teaching the Classes (Class Delivery)
*Enacting the instructional plan with flexibility and engagement*

- Facilitate active, student-centered learning (e.g., discussion, problem-solving)  
- Use storytelling, examples, demonstrations, and Socratic questioning  
- Employ tech and AI tools for content delivery (e.g., ChatGPT, simulations, visualizations)  
- Monitor engagement and comprehension in real time  
- Adapt pacing and methods responsively  

## 5. Student Support
*Promoting academic success and well-being*

- Provide office hours and timely responses to inquiries  
- Offer guidance on assignments and study strategies  
- Identify struggling students early and intervene  
- Create a climate of psychological safety and inclusiveness  
- Provide AI-curated resources (e.g., study guides, tutoring suggestions)  
- Encourage peer collaboration and support networks  

## 6. Assessment and Feedback
*Measuring learning and guiding improvement*

- Conduct assessments (projects, exams, portfolios, presentations)  
- Provide timely, specific, and constructive feedback  
- Use self- and peer-assessment tools  
- Incorporate AI for feedback generation, plagiarism detection, or automated grading (as appropriate)  
- Analyze data to identify learning gaps and misconceptions  

## 7. Reflection and Improvement
*Closing the loop through critical self-analysis and iteration*

- Reflect on teaching effectiveness using student feedback, learning data, and peer observations  
- Identify what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why  
- Revise materials, strategies, and assessments for future iterations  
- Stay engaged with research and innovations in pedagogy and educational technology  
- Share experiences with colleagues to foster a culture of reflective teaching
