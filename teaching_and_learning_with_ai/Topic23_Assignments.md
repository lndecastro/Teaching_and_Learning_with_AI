# 3. Preparation of Assignments and Exams
*This phase involves designing AI-assisted assessment strategies that align with learning goals while promoting authenticity, clarity, and integrity*

- Design formative and summative assessments aligned with the learning outcomes  
- Create authentic tasks (e.g., Quiz, exams, case studies, real-world problems, AI-assisted projects)
- Create rubrics to define performance expectations  
- Ensure accessibility and academic integrity  

## 3.1 Design Formative and Summative Assessments Aligned with Learning Outcomes

**Task:**
Create assessments that track progress (formative) and evaluate mastery (summative) based on previously defined course outcomes.

*Chain-of-Thought Prompt*
```
Explain the difference between formative and summative assessments in the context of learning. Then, generate an example of each for a course about using generative AI in higher education.
```

*Instructional Prompt*
```
Based on the following learning outcome from a course on "Teaching and Learning with AI": 
"Evaluate the benefits and limitations of using generative AI for instructional design" — 
suggest one formative and one summative assessment that align with this outcome.
```

## 🧪 2. Create Authentic Tasks (Quizzes, Exams, Case Studies, Real-World Problems, AI-Assisted Projects)

### 📌 Task:
Design assignments that reflect real-world faculty work or AI-enhanced practices in education.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Role-Based Prompt):
```
You are an instructional designer creating a real-world, authentic task for a faculty development course on AI. Create an assignment where faculty must design a teaching activity using generative AI and include a rationale for how AI enhances learning.
```

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Zero-Shot Prompt):
```
Give three examples of authentic, real-world assignments for a course on teaching with AI. Include one quiz, one AI-supported case study, and one project-based task.
```

## 📏 3. Create Rubrics to Define Performance Expectations

### 📌 Task:
Use GenAI to draft clear rubrics to ensure transparency and consistency in grading.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Instructional Prompt):
```
Create a rubric for the following assignment: 
"Design a lesson plan that incorporates generative AI tools to enhance student learning." 
Use three criteria: Pedagogical soundness, Effective AI integration, and Clarity of design.
```

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Few-Shot Prompt):
```
Example of rubric criteria for evaluating a faculty AI teaching activity:
1. Alignment with learning outcomes
2. Use of AI supports instructional purpose
3. Ethical considerations are addressed

Now generate a full 3-level rubric (Excellent, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement) based on these.
```

## 🔐 4. Ensure Accessibility and Academic Integrity

### 📌 Task:
Use GenAI to review or generate assessments with accessibility in mind and minimize integrity issues.

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Role-Based Prompt):
```
You are an educator designing an inclusive assignment using generative AI. What principles should guide your design to ensure accessibility (e.g., for neurodiverse or multilingual learners)? Include examples of modifications.
```

### 🧠 Prompt (🔹Instructional Prompt):
```
Suggest five ways to promote academic integrity in AI-assisted assignments. For each, include a strategy to monitor or mitigate misuse of generative tools.
```
