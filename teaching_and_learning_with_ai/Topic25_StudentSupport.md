```
I want to design a table to collect student information in a course. The goal is to use the data to calculate a "Student Success Score." 

1. Propose a matrix with at least 5 student variables (e.g., attendance, assignment completion, quiz scores, engagement, self-assessments).
2. For each variable, define:
   - Data type (numeric, categorical)
   - Measurement method
   - Weight or influence on success

3. Propose a formula to compute a success score from these variables (e.g., weighted average or custom equation).
4. Explain how this score can be used to monitor or support students throughout the course.
5. Save this matrix as a table in XLSX, CSV, or Google Spreadsheet format.
```

*Instructional Prompt: Guiding the LLM with a Pre-Specified Score Matrix*
```
# Prompt to Design a Student Success Score Matrix

Please provide the following details to create a matrix or table for collecting student information and calculating a success score. The matrix should include relevant student data points, and a success score will be calculated using a weighted equation. Use a clear, structured table format, and ensure the success score equation is included with explanations of each component.

## Student Information to Collect
[List the data points you want to collect for each student. Examples include:
- Student Name: [Text input, e.g., John Doe]
- Attendance Rate: [Percentage, e.g., 95%]
- Assignment Completion Rate: [Percentage, e.g., 90%]
- Quiz Average Score: [Percentage, e.g., 85%]
- Discussion Participation: [Number of posts, e.g., 5]
- Time Spent on LMS: [Hours per week, e.g., 10 hours]
Add or modify data points as needed.]

## Table Structure
[Design a table to collect the data. Example structure:
| Student Name | Attendance Rate (%) | Assignment Completion Rate (%) | Quiz Average Score (%) | Discussion Participation (Posts) | Time Spent on LMS (Hours/Week) | Success Score |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| [Name 1]     | [Percentage]        | [Percentage]                  | [Percentage]          | [Number]                        | [Hours]                       | [TBD]         |
| [Name 2]     | [Percentage]        | [Percentage]                  | [Percentage]          | [Number]                        | [Hours]                       | [TBD]         |
Ensure the table includes a column for the Success Score, which will be calculated.]

## Success Score Equation
[Define the equation to calculate the Success Score. Here is an example equation with weights assigned to each data point:
Success Score = (0.2 * Attendance Rate) + (0.3 * Assignment Completion Rate) + (0.3 * Quiz Average Score) + (0.1 * Normalized Discussion Participation) + (0.1 * Normalized Time Spent on LMS)

- **Weights Explanation**:
  - Attendance Rate (20%): Reflects engagement and consistency.
  - Assignment Completion Rate (30%): Measures task completion, a key indicator of effort.
  - Quiz Average Score (30%): Assesses academic performance.
  - Discussion Participation (10%): Gauges interaction (normalized to a 0-100 scale, e.g., max posts = 10, so 5 posts = 50%).
  - Time Spent on LMS (10%): Indicates resource usage (normalized to a 0-100 scale, e.g., max expected hours = 20, so 10 hours = 50%).

- **Normalization**:
  - Normalize Discussion Participation: (Student Posts / Max Expected Posts) * 100
  - Normalize Time Spent on LMS: (Student Hours / Max Expected Hours) * 100

Modify weights or add/remove components as needed.]

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all percentages are on a 0-100 scale for consistency.
- The Success Score should range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of success.
- Include a brief explanation of how to interpret the score (e.g., “Scores above 80 indicate strong performance, 60-80 suggest moderate success with room for improvement, below 60 indicate a need for intervention”).

## Output 
[Generate the final table and equation in a clear format, e.g.:
**Student Success Score Matrix**

| Student Name | Attendance Rate (%) | Assignment Completion Rate (%) | Quiz Average Score (%) | Discussion Participation (Posts) | Time Spent on LMS (Hours/Week) | Success Score |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| John Doe     | 95                  | 90                            | 85                    | 5                               | 10                            | [Calculated]  |
| Jane Smith   | 80                  | 70                            | 65                    | 3                               | 8                             | [Calculated]  |

**Success Score Equation**  
Success Score = (0.2 * Attendance Rate) + (0.3 * Assignment Completion Rate) + (0.3 * Quiz Average Score) + (0.1 * Normalized Discussion Participation) + (0.1 * Normalized Time Spent on LMS)

**Interpretation**  
- Above 80: Strong performance  
- 60-80: Moderate success, room for improvement  
- Below 60: Needs intervention  
]

**Output file and graphs**
- Save the generated table in an xlsx or csv spreadsheet file.
- Generate a bar graph for each student with the values in each criteria normalized in the 0-100 interval. The success score bar should have different colors for each of the three interpretations.
